# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. Histogram of total steps taken each day. 
```{r}
daily.steps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=data, FUN=sum)
barplot(daily.steps$steps, names.arg=daily.steps$date, xlab="data", ylab="steps"
```

2. Calculate mean and median of steps taken
```{r}
mean(daily.steps$steps)
median(daily.steps$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
